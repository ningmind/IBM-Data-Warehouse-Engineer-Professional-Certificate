## Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python
- Accessing Databases using Python
    - Benefits of Python for database programming
        - Python ecosystem: NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, SciPy
        - Ease of use, portable, detailed documentation
        - Python supports relational database systems
        - Python database API (e.g. MySQL C API, psycopg2, ibm_db, ODBC, OCI, JDBC)
    - DB-API
        - Definition: Python’s standard API for accessing relational databases, allows a single program to work with multiple kinds of relational databases
        - Benefits
            - Easy to implement and understand
            - Encourages similarity between the Python modules used to access databases
            - Achieves consistency
            - Portable across databases
            - Broad reach of database connectivity from Python
        - Concepts
            - Connection objects: database connections, manage transactions
            - Cursor objects: database queries, scroll through result set, retrieve results
        - Writing code using DB-API
            - Connection=connect(’databasename’,’username’,’pswd’)
            - Cursor=connection.cursor()
            - Cursor.execute(’select * from mytable’)
            - Results=cursor.fetchall()
- Views, Stored Procedures, and Transactions
    - View definition
        - Can include specified columns from multiple base tables and existing views
        - Once created, can be queried like a table
        - Only the definition of the view is stored, not the data
    - When to use a view
        - Show a selection of data for a given table
        - Combine two or more tables in meaningful ways
        - Simplify access to data
        - Show only portions of data in the table
    - Stored procedure definition
        - A set of SQL statements stored and executed on the database server (write in many different languages, accept information in the form of parameters, return results to the client)
    - Benefits of stored procedures
        - Reduction in network traffic
        - Improvement in performance
        - Reuse of code
        - Increase in security
    - Transaction definition
        - Indivisible unit of work
        - Consists of one or more SQL statements
        - Either all happens or none
    - ACID transactions
        - Atomic: all changes must be performed successfully or not at all
        - Consistent: data must be in a consistent state before and after the transaction
        - Isolated: no other process can change the data while the transaction is running
        - Durable: the changes made by the transaction must persist
    - ACID commands
        - BEGIN: start the ACID transaction
        - COMMIT: all statements complete successfully, save the new database state
        - ROLLBACK: one or more statements fail, undo changes
- JOIN Statements
    - JOIN operator
        - Combines rows from two or more tables
        - Based on a relationship
    - Outer joins
        - Left outer join: all rows from the left table & any matching rows from the right table
        - Right outer join: all rows from the right table & any matching rows from the left table
        - Full outer join: all rows from both tables
